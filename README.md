# Face Detection using OpenCV

This project is a simple implementation of face detection using OpenCV in Python. It uses a Haar Cascade classifier to detect faces in real-time from webcam input.

## 🧠 Features

- Real-time face detection using webcam
- Visual bounding boxes around detected faces
- Uses Haar cascades provided by OpenCV

## 📁 File Structure

- `FACE_DETECTION.ipynb` – Jupyter notebook containing all the code for face detection

## 🛠️ Requirements

Make sure you have the following Python packages installed:

```bash
pip install opencv-python opencv-python-headless
